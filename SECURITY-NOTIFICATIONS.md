# üö® Security Notification System

## Overview
Comprehensive super admin notification system that automatically alerts administrators when security threats are detected.

## Notification Channels

### 1. Email Alerts üìß
**Triggers**: CRITICAL and HIGH security threats
**Recipients**: Super admin email (configurable)
**Content**: Detailed threat breakdown with actionable recommendations
**Features**:
- Rich HTML email with threat categorization
- Direct links to security dashboard
- Immediate action steps
- Professional security alert formatting

### 2. Dashboard Badges üî¥
**Triggers**: CRITICAL and HIGH security threats
**Display**: Animated alert badge in dashboard header
**Behavior**:
- CRITICAL: Stays visible until resolved
- HIGH: Auto-hides after 30 seconds
- Visual distinction with color coding and animation

### 3. Console Logging üìù
**Triggers**: All security events
**Purpose**: Audit trail and debugging
**Content**: Structured security event logs with timestamps

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for email notifications
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# Optional - defaults to admin@ibam.com
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=sammeee@yahoo.com

# Optional - alert threshold (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
SECURITY_ALERT_THRESHOLD=HIGH
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **CRITICAL**: Immediate multi-channel alerts (email + dashboard + console)
- **HIGH**: Email + dashboard notifications
- **MEDIUM**: Dashboard notifications only
- **LOW**: Silent logging only

## Email Alert Content

### Critical Threat Email
```
Subject: üö® CRITICAL Security Alert - IBAM Platform

Content:
- Alert summary with risk level and exposure count
- Critical threats with immediate action required
- High priority threats requiring attention
- Direct link to security dashboard
- Timestamp and scan method details
```

### Alert Types Covered
- Exposed API keys and secrets
- Missing critical environment variables
- Database security vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass risks
- Deployment configuration issues
- Dependency security threats

## Integration Points

### Security Scanner
- Automatic threat detection every 30 seconds
- Real-time risk level assessment
- Comprehensive 6-vector security analysis

### Dashboard Integration
- Live alert badge updates
- Visual threat indicators
- One-click dashboard access

### Email Service (Resend)
- Professional HTML email templates
- Reliable delivery system
- Security-focused branding

## Alert Flow

1. **Detection**: Security scanner identifies threat
2. **Assessment**: Risk level calculated (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. **Notification**: Multi-channel alerts dispatched based on severity
4. **Dashboard Update**: Visual indicators updated in real-time
5. **Logging**: Security event logged for audit trail

## Testing Notifications

To test the notification system:

1. **Simulate Critical Threat**:
   ```bash
   # Remove a critical environment variable temporarily
   # This will trigger CRITICAL level alerts
   ```

2. **Check Email Delivery**:
   - Monitor configured super admin email
   - Check spam folder if not received
   - Verify RESEND_API_KEY configuration

3. **Verify Dashboard Badges**:
   - Visit `/admin/security` dashboard
   - Look for animated alert badges
   - Test auto-hide behavior for HIGH alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Email Alerts Not Working
- ‚úÖ Check RESEND_API_KEY is configured
- ‚úÖ Verify super admin email address
- ‚úÖ Check Resend service status
- ‚úÖ Review server logs for delivery errors

### Dashboard Badges Not Showing
- ‚úÖ Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- ‚úÖ Check browser console for errors
- ‚úÖ Verify WebSocket connections
- ‚úÖ Clear browser cache and reload

### Alert Fatigue Prevention
- Smart threshold system prevents notification spam
- Auto-hide feature for non-critical alerts
- Consolidated threat reporting in single emails
- 30-second refresh cycle prevents excessive alerts

## Security Best Practices

1. **Secure Email Configuration**:
   - Use environment variables for sensitive config
   - Never hardcode API keys in source code
   - Regular rotation of Resend API keys

2. **Alert Response**:
   - Immediate action on CRITICAL alerts
   - Regular review of HIGH and MEDIUM threats
   - Maintain security event audit logs

3. **System Monitoring**:
   - Monitor notification delivery success rates
   - Regular testing of alert channels
   - Backup notification methods for redundancy

## Future Enhancements

- **SMS Alerts**: For CRITICAL threats only
- **Slack/Discord Integration**: Team notifications
- **Push Notifications**: Browser-based alerts
- **Webhook Integration**: Custom notification endpoints
- **Alert Escalation**: Multi-tier notification system
