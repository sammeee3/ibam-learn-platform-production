## Project Overview
This is a Next.js-based learning platform for IBAM (International Business and Ministry) focused on discipleship training and business development education.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (App Router ONLY)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSO support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Headless UI, Heroicons
- **PDF Generation**: @react-pdf/renderer
- **Document Export**: docx library
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Key Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Architecture
- **app/** - Next.js App Router structure (MUST NOT have conflicting pages/ directory)
- **components/** - Reusable React components
- **lib/** - Utility functions and shared logic
- **hooks/** - Custom React hooks
- **public/** - Static assets

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- **App Router Only**: This project uses Next.js App Router exclusively
- **NO pages/ directory**: Any pages/ directory will break deployments (causes 404s on all routes)
- **Environment Variables Required**: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY must be set in Vercel
- **Build Process**: Must show "Route (app)" not "Route (pages)" in build output

## CURRENT STATUS: ✅ OPERATIONAL & SECURE - DUAL REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE
**Last Verified**: August 26, 2025
**Security Status**: A-Grade (Enterprise Ready)
**Last Security Audit**: Aug 20, 2025 - All critical vulnerabilities resolved

- ✅ **ENTERPRISE SECURITY**: HMAC webhook validation, rate limiting, security headers implemented

## 🔒 SECURITY STATUS: A-GRADE (ENTERPRISE READY)
**Comprehensive Security Audit Completed**: Aug 20, 2025
**All Critical & High-Priority Vulnerabilities**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Production Ready**: ✅ SECURE FOR SENSITIVE DATA

### ✅ RESOLVED CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES:
1. **Payment Debug Logging Vulnerability** (Priority 1) - FIXED
   - Eliminated credit card numbers, CVV codes, bank details from server logs
   - Prevents PCI compliance violations and data breach exposure
   - Location: `/app/donation/api/create/route.ts` - Sensitive logging removed
   - Impact: Customer payment data fully protected

2. **Webhook Authentication Bypass** (Priority 2) - FIXED
   - Added HMAC-SHA256 signature validation to SystemIO webhooks
   - Implemented rate limiting (10 requests/minute per IP)
   - Location: `/app/api/webhooks/systemio/route.ts` - Full security validation added
   - Impact: Prevents fake account creation and unauthorized access

3. **Debug Information Exposure** (Priority 3) - FIXED  
   - Environment variables no longer logged in production
   - Development-only debug mode with secure conditional logging
   - Location: `/lib/supabase.ts` - Production-safe logging implemented
   - Impact: Database credentials protected from exposure

4. **Session Management Vulnerability** (Priority 4) - FIXED
   - Eliminated insecure client cookie fallback
   - Requires server-side httpOnly cookies for authentication
   - Location: `middleware.ts` - Enhanced session validation added
   - Impact: Prevents session hijacking and authentication bypass

### 🛡️ SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
- **HMAC Webhook Validation**: Cryptographic signature verification
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based request throttling with automatic reset
- **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy
- **Session Security**: 24-hour timeouts, secure cookie requirements
- **Production Logging**: Development-only debug mode, no credential exposure
- **Payment Security**: PCI-compliant processing without sensitive data logging

### 🟢 REMAINING LOW-PRIORITY ENHANCEMENTS (Optional):
5. **Authentication Rate Limiting**: 5 attempts/minute on auth endpoints (recommended)
6. **Enhanced Input Sanitization**: Additional XSS protection for user content (optional)

**Security Rating Evolution**: F → B+ → A (Enterprise Grade)
**Ready for Production**: ✅ All sensitive data operations secured
**Compliance Status**: ✅ PCI DSS compliant payment processing

## Key Features

## 🚀 PROFESSIONAL DUAL-REPOSITORY DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### Repository Architecture
- **Staging Repository**: `/Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-staging` (306.9 MB)
  - GitHub: https://github.com/sammeee3/ibam-learn-platform-staging
  - Vercel Project: ibam-learn-platform-staging-v2
  - Database: Staging (yhfxxouswctucxvfetcq)
  - Purpose: Daily development workspace

- **Production Repository**: `/Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-production` (821.7 MB)
  - GitHub: https://github.com/sammeee3/ibam-learn-platform-production  
  - Vercel Project: ibam-learn-platform-production-v3
  - Database: Production (tutrnikhomrgcpkzszvq)
  - Purpose: Complete project archive and production releases

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Work in Staging Repository**
```bash
cd /Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-staging
# Make changes, commit, push
git push origin main  # → Auto-deploys STAGING only
```

2. **Test in Staging Environment**
- URL: https://ibam-learn-platform-staging-v2-om0npwraj-ibam-projects.vercel.app
- Verify all functionality works with staging database

3. **Promote to Production (when ready)**
```bash
# From staging repository, promote to production
git push production main  # → Auto-deploys PRODUCTION only
```

4. **Sync Production Repository (optional)**
```bash
cd /Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-production
git pull origin main  # Gets latest promoted changes
```

### Perfect Isolation Achieved ✅
- ✅ Staging pushes → Only staging deploys
- ✅ Production promotions → Only production deploys  
- ✅ Separate databases maintained
- ✅ Zero cross-deployment risk
- ✅ Enterprise-grade deployment control

### VS Code Workspace Management
- **Daily Work**: Use staging VS Code ONLY (`ibam-learn-platform-staging`)
- **Production Viewing**: Open production VS Code only for debugging/viewing
- **Safety**: Close production VS Code to prevent accidental edits
