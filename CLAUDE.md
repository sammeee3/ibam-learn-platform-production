# IBAM Learning Platform v2

## Project Overview
This is a Next.js-based learning platform for IBAM (International Business and Ministry) focused on discipleship training and business development education.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (App Router ONLY)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with SSO support
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Headless UI, Heroicons
- **PDF Generation**: @react-pdf/renderer
- **Document Export**: docx library
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Key Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Architecture
- **app/** - Next.js App Router structure (MUST NOT have conflicting pages/ directory)
- **components/** - Reusable React components
- **lib/** - Utility functions and shared logic
- **hooks/** - Custom React hooks
- **public/** - Static assets

## CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT NOTES
- **App Router Only**: This project uses Next.js App Router exclusively
- **NO pages/ directory**: Any pages/ directory will break deployments (causes 404s on all routes)
- **Environment Variables Required**: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY must be set in Vercel
- **Build Process**: Must show "Route (app)" not "Route (pages)" in build output

## CURRENT STATUS: âœ… OPERATIONAL - DUAL REPOSITORY ARCHITECTURE
**Last Verified**: Aug 19, 2025 4:13 PM
- âœ… **Production URL**: https://ibam-learn-platform-v3.vercel.app
- âœ… **Staging URL**: https://ibam-learn-platform-staging-v2-jeff-samuelsons-projects.vercel.app
- âœ… **PERFECT DEPLOYMENT ISOLATION**: Staging and production completely isolated via separate repositories
- âœ… **Staging Repository**: ibam-learn-platform-staging (clean, daily development workspace)
- âœ… **Production Repository**: ibam-learn-platform-v2 (complete archive with all history)
- âœ… **System.io Integration**: Working on both staging and production with correct database separation
- âœ… **User Identification**: Dashboard shows user names and dropdown works
- âœ… **All API Routes**: Working correctly with App Router
- âœ… **Samuelson Donation Page**: Complete donation system preserved in staging repository
- âœ… **Database Projects**: Production (tutrnikhomrgcpkzszvq) and Staging (yhfxxouswctucxvfetcq) environments

## Key Features
- Module-based learning system with sessions
- Assessment system (pre/post assessments)
- Business planner tool
- AI coaching integration
- Progress tracking
- SSO authentication
- **System.io Integration** - Automated user creation and seamless access
- **Webhook System** - Automatic user enrollment from external platforms
- **Magic Token Authentication** - Passwordless access for external users
- Donation system
- Admin dashboard

## Authentication Flow
- Multiple auth routes supporting direct login, SSO, and token-based auth
- **Webhook-based user creation** - Automatic account setup from System.io
- **Magic token system** - Secure passwordless authentication
- **SSO integration** - Seamless access from external platforms
- Session management with JWT tokens
- Middleware for route protection

## User Identification System
- **Dashboard Title**: Shows "Welcome Back, Entrepreneur, [FirstName]!" 
- **Dropdown Menu**: Displays user email in Account section
- **localStorage Setup**: Email stored via URL parameter from SSO redirect
- **Cookie Strategy**: Both ibam_auth (client) and ibam_auth_server (server) cookies

## Database Structure
- User profiles and authentication
- **Magic token storage** - Secure token management in user_profiles table
- Course modules and sessions
- Progress tracking
- Assessment results
- Business plan data

## System.io Integration
- **Webhook Endpoint**: `/api/webhooks/systemio` - Receives user enrollment data and creates complete user accounts
- **Magic Token System**: Automatic passwordless authentication for external users (24-hour expiry)
- **Email Entry Form**: `SYSTEMIO-EMAIL-FORM.html` - Beautiful manual email entry with IBAM theming
- **Staging Email Form**: `SYSTEMIO-EMAIL-FORM-STAGING.html` - Staging version with proper deployment URL
- **Technical Limitation**: System.io merge tags (`[Email]`) only work in emails/redirects, not HTML buttons
- **Current Solution**: Manual email entry with validation, localStorage memory, and security warnings
- **Automatic User Creation**: Webhook creates auth users + user profiles + magic tokens
- **Database Integration**: Works with both production and staging environments
- **Environment Isolation**: Staging uses staging database (yhfxxouswctucxvfetcq), production uses production database (tutrnikhomrgcpkzszvq)

## ðŸš€ PROFESSIONAL DUAL-REPOSITORY DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### Repository Architecture
- **Staging Repository**: `/Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-staging` (306.9 MB)
  - GitHub: https://github.com/sammeee3/ibam-learn-platform-staging
  - Vercel Project: ibam-learn-platform-staging-v2
  - Database: Staging (yhfxxouswctucxvfetcq)
  - Purpose: Daily development workspace

- **Production Repository**: `/Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-v2` (821.7 MB)
  - GitHub: https://github.com/sammeee3/ibam-learn-platform-v2  
  - Vercel Project: ibam-learn-platform-production-v3
  - Database: Production (tutrnikhomrgcpkzszvq)
  - Purpose: Complete project archive and production releases

### Daily Development Workflow

1. **Work in Staging Repository**
```bash
cd /Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-staging
# Make changes, commit, push
git push origin main  # â†’ Auto-deploys STAGING only
```

2. **Test in Staging Environment**
- URL: https://ibam-learn-platform-staging-v2-jeff-samuelsons-projects.vercel.app
- Verify all functionality works with staging database

3. **Promote to Production (when ready)**
```bash
# From staging repository, promote to production
git push production main  # â†’ Auto-deploys PRODUCTION only
```

4. **Sync Production Repository (optional)**
```bash
cd /Users/jeffreysamuelson/Desktop/ibam-learn-platform-v2
git pull origin main  # Gets latest promoted changes
```

### Perfect Isolation Achieved âœ…
- âœ… Staging pushes â†’ Only staging deploys
- âœ… Production promotions â†’ Only production deploys  
- âœ… Separate databases maintained
- âœ… Zero cross-deployment risk
- âœ… Enterprise-grade deployment control

### VS Code Workspace Management
- **Daily Work**: Use staging VS Code ONLY (`ibam-learn-platform-staging`)
- **Production Viewing**: Open production VS Code only for debugging/viewing
- **Safety**: Close production VS Code to prevent accidental edits

## Important Notes
- Uses Supabase for backend services
- Implements comprehensive session tracking
- Supports multiple user types (learners, trainers, admins)
- **Full System.io integration** - Automated enrollment and access
- **CORS-compliant authentication** - Works across domains
- Includes donation/payment functionality
- Mobile-responsive design
