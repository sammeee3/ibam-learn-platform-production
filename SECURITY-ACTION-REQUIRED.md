# üö® URGENT SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED

## Critical Security Issue Found
GitHub detected exposed Supabase API keys in your repository. These keys provide FULL DATABASE ACCESS.

## Exposed Keys Found In:
- Multiple `.js` files (test scripts, migration scripts)
- Service role keys for both staging and production databases
- These keys are now PUBLIC on GitHub (even after deletion, they exist in git history)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

### 1. Regenerate Supabase API Keys NOW
**For STAGING Database:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yhfxxouswctucxvfetcq/settings/api
2. Click "Regenerate" for BOTH:
   - `anon` key
   - `service_role` key
3. Save the new keys

**For PRODUCTION Database:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/tutrnikhomrgcpkzszvq/settings/api
2. Click "Regenerate" for BOTH:
   - `anon` key  
   - `service_role` key
3. Save the new keys

### 2. Update Environment Variables
**In Vercel (BOTH projects):**
1. Staging: https://vercel.com/ibam-projects/ibam-learn-platform-staging/settings/environment-variables
2. Production: https://vercel.com/ibam-projects/ibam-learn-platform-production-v3/settings/environment-variables
3. Update:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

**Locally:**
1. Update `.env.local` with new keys
2. NEVER commit `.env` files to git

### 3. What I've Done So Far:
- ‚úÖ Added all sensitive files to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ Removed tracked files from git
- ‚úÖ Pushed changes to prevent future exposure

### 4. What Still Needs To Be Done:
- ‚ùå Regenerate all Supabase API keys (YOU must do this)
- ‚ùå Update keys in Vercel environment variables
- ‚ùå Update local `.env.local` file
- ‚ùå Consider using GitHub secrets for any CI/CD needs

## Why This Is Critical:
- Anyone with these keys can:
  - Read/write/delete ALL your database data
  - Create/delete users
  - Access payment information
  - Modify any data in your system

## Prevention Going Forward:
1. NEVER hardcode API keys in `.js` or `.ts` files
2. Always use environment variables
3. Keep `.env` files in `.gitignore`
4. Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD
5. Regularly rotate API keys

## Timeline:
**Do this IMMEDIATELY** - The keys are already exposed publicly on GitHub!
