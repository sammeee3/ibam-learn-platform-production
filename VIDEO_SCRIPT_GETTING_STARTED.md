## OPENING (10 seconds)
**[Big smile, warm greeting]**

"Hey friend! Jeffrey here, and I'm SO excited you're joining the IBAM journey! 

In the next 2 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to succeed on this platform and transform both your business AND your faith."

---

## THE IBAM METHOD (30 seconds)
**[Show enthusiasm about the method]**

"First, let me share the secret sauce - it's how Jesus trained His disciples, and it's how you'll build your business.

Every session follows three simple steps:
- LOOK BACK - Review your progress and actions
- LOOK UP - Connect with God's Word for guidance  
- LOOK FORWARD - Plan concrete next steps

This isn't just learning - it's DOING. Faith without works is dead, right? So we learn by taking action!"

---

## CHOOSING YOUR PATH (20 seconds)
**[Speak directly to different types of learners]**

"Now, you get to choose HOW you learn:

Want to go solo? Choose INDIVIDUAL study - learn at your own pace, on your own time.

Want community? Choose GROUP study - iron sharpens iron, and you'll grow faster with others!

You also pick your pace - FAST TRACK if you're ready to transform in 5 weeks, or STEADY PACE if you want to go deeper over 10 weeks."

## HOW THE PLATFORM WORKS (40 seconds)
**[Show excitement about the features]**

"Here's what I love about this platform:

First, it SAVES everything automatically. Close your laptop, come back tomorrow - you're right where you left off. The 'Continue Session' button is magic!

Second, you can DOWNLOAD everything - your action plans, notes, even your complete business plan as a PDF. Your work is always yours.

Third, it works on EVERYTHING - phone, tablet, computer. Learn in line at Starbucks or at your desk. 

And if you get stuck? Hit that purple BETA button - I personally read every single piece of feedback!"
