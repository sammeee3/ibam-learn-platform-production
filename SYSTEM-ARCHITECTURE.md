**Purpose**: Determines platform access based on payment/subscription
**Management**: Automated via System.io webhooks

| Membership Level | System.io Product | Platform Access | Launch Phase |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Basic Member | Basic Subscription | Core courses, basic tools | Phase 1 âœ… |
| Entrepreneur Member | Entrepreneur Package | Advanced courses, business planner | Phase 1 âœ… |
| Advanced Business Member | Premium Package | All content, AI coaching | Phase 1 âœ… |
| Small Church Partner | Church Tier 1 | Branded platform, 50 users | Phase 1 âœ… |
| Medium Church Partner | Church Tier 2 | Branded platform, 150 users | Phase 1 âœ… |
| Large Church Partner | Church Tier 3 | Branded platform, 500+ users | Phase 1 âœ… |

**Future Growth Options (Built-in but Not Initially Active):**
| Membership Level | System.io Product | Platform Access | Launch Phase |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Small Church Premium | Church Tier 1 White | White-label platform, 50 users | Phase 2 ðŸ”® |
| Medium Church Premium | Church Tier 2 White | White-label platform, 150 users | Phase 2 ðŸ”® |
| Large Church Premium | Church Tier 3 White | White-label platform, 500+ users | Phase 2 ðŸ”® |

#### 2. Platform Roles (Internal Management)
**Purpose**: Defines what users can DO within the platform
**Management**: Manual assignment by administrators

| Platform Role | Capabilities | Membership Independence |

## Technical Architecture

### Growth-Ready Foundation Design

**Core Principle**: Build architecture that supports **configuration-driven growth** rather than code rewrites.

### Database Schema (Future-Proof Design)

#### Current Tables (Existing):
- `user_profiles` - Basic user information
- `user_progress` - Learning progress tracking
- `sessions` - Course session data
- `magic_tokens` - Secure authentication tokens

#### New Tables (Growth-Ready):

```

### Growth-Ready Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Configuration-Driven Pricing
```typescript
// Easy to add new tiers without code changes
interface MembershipConfig {
  tierSize: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'
  brandingLevel: 'ibam_partnership' | 'white_label'
  maxUsers: number
  featuresEnabled: string[]
  pricingTier: number
  launchPhase: 'phase_1' | 'phase_2' | 'future'
}

// Example configurations:
const membershipConfigs = {
  small_ibam: {
    tierSize: 'small',
    brandingLevel: 'ibam_partnership',
    maxUsers: 50,
    featuresEnabled: ['basic_branding', 'group_management'],
    launchPhase: 'phase_1'
  },
  small_white: {  // Ready but inactive
    tierSize: 'small', 
    brandingLevel: 'white_label',
    maxUsers: 50,
    featuresEnabled: ['custom_domain', 'white_label', 'group_management'],
    launchPhase: 'phase_2'
  }
}
```

#### 2. Feature Flag System
```typescript
// Easy to enable new features per tier
class FeatureManager {
  async isFeatureEnabled(
    featureName: string, 
    membershipLevel: string,
    brandingLevel: string
  ): Promise<boolean>
  
  async enableFeatureForTier(
    featureName: string,
    targetTiers: string[]
  ): Promise<void>
}

// Usage examples:
await features.isFeatureEnabled('custom_domain', 'small', 'white_label')
await features.isFeatureEnabled('advanced_analytics', 'large', 'ibam_partnership')
```

#### 3. Scalable Church Configuration
```typescript
interface ChurchConfig {
  brandingLevel: 'ibam_partnership' | 'white_label'
  customDomain?: string           // NULL for Phase 1
  urlSlug: string                // first-baptist
  brandingOptions: {
    logo?: string
    primaryColor: string
    secondaryColor: string
    welcomeMessage: string
    showIbamBranding: boolean    // false for white-label
  }
  featuresEnabled: string[]
  maxStudents: number
}
```

### Permission System Design

#### Permission Categories:
- **SYSTEM**: Platform administration
- **CONTENT**: Course and material management  
- **CHURCH**: Church platform management
- **GROUP**: Group and student management
- **ANALYTICS**: Reporting and progress viewing
- **SECURITY**: Security dashboard and monitoring

#### Sample Permissions:
```json
{
  "SYSTEM_ADMIN": ["*"],
  "CHURCH_LEADER": [
    "CHURCH_MANAGE_SETTINGS",
    "CHURCH_APPOINT_AMBASSADORS", 
    "CHURCH_VIEW_ALL_GROUPS",
    "ANALYTICS_CHURCH_REPORTS"
  ],
  "BUSINESS_AMBASSADOR": [
    "GROUP_CREATE",
    "GROUP_MANAGE_STUDENTS",
    "CONTENT_ACCESS_MATERIALS",
    "ANALYTICS_GROUP_REPORTS"
  ]
}
```

## System.io Integration Requirements

### Webhook Data Flow

#### Membership Purchase Event:
```json
{
  "event": "purchase_completed",
  "customer": {
    "email": "leader@church.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith"
  },
  "product": {
    "id": "church_tier_2",
    "name": "Medium Church Partner"
  },
  "transaction": {
    "id": "txn_12345",
    "amount": 299.00
  }
}
```

#### Automated Processing:
1. **Validate** webhook signature (HMAC-SHA256)
2. **Create** user account if not exists
3. **Assign** membership level based on product ID
4. **Provision** church organization (for church tiers)
5. **Generate** magic token for seamless login
6. **Send** welcome email with platform access

### Required System.io Product Mapping:
| System.io Product ID | Internal Membership | User Limit | Features |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------|----------|
| `basic_member` | Basic Member | 1 | Core courses |
| `entrepreneur_member` | Entrepreneur Member | 1 | + Business planner |
| `advanced_member` | Advanced Business Member | 1 | + AI coaching |
| `church_tier_1` | Small Church Partner | 50 | + IBAM-branded platform |
| `church_tier_2` | Medium Church Partner | 150 | + Advanced analytics |
| `church_tier_3` | Large Church Partner | 500+ | + Priority support |

### Multi-Role Architecture for Cross-Organization Users

#### The Challenge:
**One email address needs multiple roles across different contexts**
- User could be a "Church Leader" at First Baptist
- Same user could be a "Business Ambassador" at Second Presbyterian  
- Same user could be an "Individual Entrepreneur Member"
- Super Admin needs ability to assign/remove any role to any user

#### Solution: Context-Aware Role System
```typescript
interface UserRole {
  userId: string
  roleId: string
  context: {
    type: 'global' | 'church' | 'group' | 'individual'
    contextId?: string  // church_id or group_id
    contextName?: string // 'First Baptist Church'
  }
  assignedBy: string
  assignedAt: Date
  isActive: boolean
}

// Example: One user with multiple roles
const exampleUser = "john@email.com"
const johnRoles = [
  {
    userId: "john@email.com",
    roleId: "church_leader", 
    context: { type: 'church', contextId: 'church_123', contextName: 'First Baptist' }
  },
  {
    userId: "john@email.com", 
    roleId: "business_ambassador",
    context: { type: 'church', contextId: 'church_456', contextName: 'Second Presbyterian' }
  },
  {
    userId: "john@email.com",
    roleId: "entrepreneur_member",
    context: { type: 'individual' }
  }
]
```

## Security & Access Control

### Current Security Status: A-Grade âœ…
- HMAC webhook validation
- Automated security monitoring
- Session management with httpOnly cookies
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Security dashboard with real-time alerts

### Role-Based Security Implementation:
- **Permission-based access control** (not role name checking)
- **Audit trails** for all role assignments and changes
- **Context-aware permissions** (church-specific, group-specific)
- **Escalation protection** (prevent accidental privilege elevation)

### Church Multi-Tenancy Security:
- **Data isolation** between church organizations
- **Student privacy** protection within groups
- **Ambassador boundaries** (can't access other ambassadors' groups)
- **Church leader oversight** of all church activities

---

## Scalability Considerations

### Technical Scalability:
- **Database partitioning** by church organization
- **Caching strategies** for role permissions
- **CDN integration** for white-labeled assets
- **Background job processing** for large operations

### Business Scalability:
- **Flexible membership pricing** via System.io
- **Automated church provisioning** without manual intervention
- **Self-service church management** reducing support overhead
- **Modular feature enabling** based on membership tier
