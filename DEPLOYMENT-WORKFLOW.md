# ðŸš€ PROFESSIONAL DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

## Repository Setup
- **Staging Repo**: `ibam-learn-platform-staging` (daily development)
- **Production Repo**: `ibam-learn-platform-v2` (stable releases)

## Daily Development Workflow

### 1. Work in Staging
```bash
cd ibam-learn-platform-staging
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main  # â†’ Auto-deploys STAGING only
```

### 2. Test in Staging
- Staging URL: https://ibam-learn-platform-staging-v2-jeff-samuelsons-projects.vercel.app
- Verify all functionality works
- Test with staging database

### 3. Promote to Production (when ready)
```bash
# Push staging code to production repo
git push production main  # â†’ Auto-deploys PRODUCTION only
```

## Perfect Isolation Achieved
- âœ… Staging pushes â†’ Only staging deploys
- âœ… Production promotions â†’ Only production deploys  
- âœ… Separate databases maintained
- âœ… Zero cross-deployment risk

## For Future Sessions
When you say "deploy to production", Claude will:
1. Verify staging is working
2. Run: `git push production main`
3. Monitor production deployment
4. Confirm success

ðŸŽ¯ **Enterprise-grade deployment control achieved!**
