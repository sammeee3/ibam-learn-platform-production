// AI Coaching Responses
export const aiCoachingResponses: Record<string, { response: string; followUp: string; }> = {
  "How do I apply this to my business?": {
    response: "Great question! Start with one specific area where you can demonstrate excellence this week. For example, if you run a service business, focus on exceeding one customer's expectations through quality and genuine care. As Colossians 3:23 reminds us, 'Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.' This isn't about perfection - it's about intentionality. What's one specific way you could show God's character through your business this week?",
    followUp: "What type of business are you in? I can give more specific guidance."
  },
  "What if I'm just starting out?": {
    response: "Starting out is actually a blessing! You have the opportunity to build biblical foundations from day one. Focus on three things: 1) Integrity in all dealings, no matter how small, 2) Excellence in your craft - become genuinely skilled at what you do, 3) Service heart - always ask 'How can I truly help this person?' Remember Luke 16:10 - 'One who is faithful in very little is also faithful in much.' God is watching how you handle these early opportunities.",
    followUp: "What's the biggest challenge you're facing as you start your business?"
  },
  "How do I balance profit and ministry?": {
    response: "This is a false dichotomy many Christians struggle with! Profit and ministry work together when done biblically. Profit provides resources for generosity, family provision, and ministry support. The key is pursuing profit through biblical means (integrity, excellence, service) and using profit for biblical purposes. A profitable business can fund far more ministry than a struggling one. Think of profit as the fuel for your Faith-Driven impact, not the enemy of it.",
    followUp: "What ministry opportunities are you sensing God wants to fund through your business success?"
  },
  "How can I share my faith without being pushy?": {
    response: "The most powerful witness is consistent Christian character demonstrated through your business practices. Let your integrity, generosity, and excellence speak first. Build genuine relationships with customers and employees. When people ask about your motivation or values, share naturally. Your business can become a lighthouse in your community - people will be drawn to the light they see in how you operate.",
    followUp: "What opportunities for natural conversation do you see in your current business interactions?"
