  welcomeMessage: `ðŸ¤– **IBAM Coaching Assistant**

Hi! I'm here to assist you with questions and guidance, backed by experienced IBAM business coaches who follow Jesus. Think of me as having their collective wisdom available to you 24/7.

**I'm here to help as much as you want or need** - whether that's quick questions, working through decisions, or exploring biblical business principles together.

**Try using me first for your coaching needs** - I can help you work through most situations right away.

**Want human connection?** You can request a volunteer IBAM coach [here]. Our volunteer coaches are amazing - they're running businesses and performing ministry themselves, so they love connecting with startup entrepreneurs like you! Just keep in mind they're volunteers with their own businesses, so response times may vary.

**Coming soon:** We're also working on paid coaching options for more intensive support.

**Rest assured:** Real IBAM business coaches who follow Jesus are behind our conversation, and everything I share comes from their experience helping entrepreneurs honor God in business.

**Ready to explore how God might be calling you in business?**`,
