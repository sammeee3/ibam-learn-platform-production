IMPORTANT: Get the Staging Service Role Key
============================================

The service role key in our files appears to be invalid or expired.
You need to get the correct one from Supabase:

1. Go to Staging Supabase Dashboard:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/yhfxxouswctucxvfetcq

2. Navigate to: Settings â†’ API

3. Find the "service_role" key (NOT the anon key!)
   - It will be a long string starting with "eyJ..."
   - This key has FULL access to the database

4. Copy that key and update the import script:
   - Open: import-production-to-staging.js
   - Replace the key on line 14
   - Save the file

5. Then run: node import-production-to-staging.js

NOTE: The service_role key is different from the anon key!
- anon key = limited access (for public users)
- service_role key = full access (for admin operations)
